## Analyze the data:

Calculates mean values grouped by species

## Create visualizations:

Line chart showing sepal and petal length trends
Bar chart of average sepal length by species
Histogram of petal width distribution
Scatter plot showing relationship between sepal and petal length
All visualizations will be saved as PNG files in your working directory. The script includes proper error handling and follows Python best practices. Each visualization includes appropriate titles, labels, and legends.
